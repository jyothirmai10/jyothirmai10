<P>
 I had done one project in my PG in Cloud Computing domain which is related to  accessing control the data when a data owner is not available and how the data owner give the accessing rights to the trusted users. To achive this we used some accessing control mechanism like Attribute-based Encryption and Proxy Re-Encryption techniques.By these techiques we attain trust based accessing control in cloud computing.
 Presently I had desing a webpage regarding my protfolio which is created by using HTML and CSS.</P>
